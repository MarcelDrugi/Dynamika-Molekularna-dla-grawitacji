
| Simple program to modeling gravitational systems using molecular dynamics.
| The program has gui to visualize the movement of celestial bodies
| and modify simulation parameters in real time.
| 
Newton's equations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
| Motion equations are integrated with the use two variants of
| Verlet Algorithm (Velocity Verlet and Leapfrog Verlet).
| Both algorithms are stable for a fixed time-step that allows
| model in long time with sufficient performance and a constant error.
GUI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
| The program contains gui created in PyQt5. GUI allows visualization 
| of movement and trajectory. It also allows you to modify the time step 
| during the simulation.
